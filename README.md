## Description

Case study project I've made for one of the subjects in college.

The task was to create an application to help customers find an information about shop's product by scanning a QR code placed on a product or by writing product's reference number. Also shop's staff needs a posibiilty to add / edit / delete products. I combined this two functionalities in one web app.
